  &nbsp;In the previous post, we confirmed that binding the Text Property of the TextBox control to the Title member
  variable with the ObservableProperty Attribute in the MainWindowViewModel class and changing the value of the Title
  variable in the ViewModel reflects the value in the View.
</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">
  &nbsp;This time, we will look at the change event callbacks of the Title variable bound by the user entering text in
  the TextBox from the UI.

<p data-ke-size="size16">
  When the ObservableProperty attribute is declared, the following callback functions are automatically generated by the
  code generator in addition to the getter and setter code that calls the PropertyChanged event.

  In Visual Studio, when you type partial and press the spacebar or tab key, intellisense automatically lists the
  available callback functions in the suggestion list.

<p data-ke-size="size16">
  &nbsp;The naming convention of the function is automatically generated in the form of
  On[MemberVariableName]Changing/Changed for the member variable with the ObservableProperty attribute. In the case of
  Changing, it is a callback function that is called before the setter of the Title variable is called, with the changed
  value passed as the value argument from the control bound to the view. In the case of Changed, it is called after the
  value of Title has changed.
</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">
  &nbsp;To check the order in which each callback function is called, set breakpoints (F9) on all callback functions.

<p data-ke-size="size16">
  &nbsp;After building and running by pressing the F5 key, you can see that it stops at each callback function where the
  breakpoint is set in order. Leave the breakpoints as they are and press F5 to continue running the program, then
  change the value in the TextBox of the window.

<p data-ke-size="size16">
  &nbsp;However, for some reason, you will find that no matter how much you enter a value in the TextBox, it does not
  hit the breakpoints of the change callback.
</p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">
  &nbsp;The reason is that when binding the Title variable of the ViewModel in the previous post, the Update Trigger
  method was not specified separately, so it operated in the default mode and the callback functions of the ViewModel
  were not called.

  &nbsp;Since the callback functions of the ViewModel are triggered only by the PropertyChanged event, change the Update
  Trigger mode in the TextBox binding options of the MainWindow View to PropertyChanged as follows.

<p data-ke-size="size16">
  &nbsp;After modifying and saving the View file, press any key to enter text in the TextBox, and you will see that it
  immediately hits the breakpoints set in the change callbacks.
